{"name":"WOSCOPS","tagline":"WOSCOPS Open Shopping Cart Over Parse and Stripe","body":"# WOSCOPS\r\nAn open source and free online store front for independent artists to market directly to the public, initially for [sintamani](http://www.sintamani.com).\r\nThe intention is to have a completely free implementation of an ecommerce website, albeit using proprietary web services (Stripe and Parse). It is aimed at those just starting out, or for those with small inventory ecommerce requirements. \r\n\r\n### Work in Progress\r\nThis is currently (Aug 2014) non-functional, so any coding help gratefully received.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\nBased on the following...\r\n### [AngularJS Shopping Cart](https://github.com/kenyee/angularjs-cart)\r\nFor the AngularJS shop front code, which in turn is a fork from [Bernado Castilho's sample on Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/576246/A-Shopping-Cart-Application-Built-with-AngularJS).\r\n### [PureCSS](http://purecss.io/)\r\nFor the CSS layout (Photo Gallery and Landing Page).\r\n### [Stripe Shop](https://github.com/stripe/shop)\r\nFor the backend server Parse code (with which I need a lot of help).\r\n\r\n## Services\r\nRequires accounts with...\r\n### [Stripe](https://stripe.com)\r\nTo accept credit card payments. This is limited to specific countries, including UK, USA, Canada (maybe others).\r\n### [Parse](https://parse.com/)\r\nTo host the server backend (cloud). The shop itself can also be hosted within the cloud, which offers a free https page necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
